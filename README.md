# Automated Customer Support Response Generator
This project aims to build a model that can generate automated responses to customer queries. 
Using a transformer-based model (T5), we train it on a dataset of customer queries and their corresponding responses. 
The final model can be used to generate relevant and coherent responses to new customer queries.

## Project Structure
 Dataset: The dataset contains customer queries and their respective responses.
 Model: We use a transformer-based model (T5) to generate responses.
 Training: The model is fine-tuned on the dataset to ensure relevance and coherence.
 Demo: A demo is provided to input a query and receive an automated response.
## Files:
 Customer-Support.csv: The dataset containing customer queries and responses.
 automated_response_generator.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing code for loading the dataset, training the model, and generating responses.
## Requirements
Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook
Python 3.x
## Libraries:
pandas
torch
transformers
## Setup and Usage
### 1. Load and Preprocess the Dataset
Mount Google Drive to access the dataset and load it into a Pandas DataFrame. Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values and cleaning the text.

### 2. Define Custom Dataset Class
Create a custom dataset class to handle tokenization and data preparation for the model.

### 3. Tokenizer and Model Initialization
Initialize the T5 tokenizer and model.

### 4. Create Data Loaders
Split the dataset into training and validation sets, and create data loaders for efficient data batching.

### 5. Training Functions
Define functions for training and validating the model.

### 6. Training Loop
Train the model for a specified number of epochs, monitoring the training and validation losses.

### 7. Generate Responses
Define a function to generate responses given a customer query using the trained model.

### 8. Demo
Provide a demo to input a query and display the generated response.

## Code: 
Go to automated_response_generator.ipynb file

# Results:
After training the model, you can use the generate_response function to generate responses for any customer query.
The display_responses function demonstrates how to use the trained model to generate responses for a sample of queries from the dataset.

# Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how to use a transformer-based model (T5) to generate automated responses to customer queries. 
By fine-tuning the model on a dataset of queries and responses, we can create a system that provides relevant and coherent responses to new queries.
